Presenting the code for the Anomalous Floquet-Anderson Insulator
===============================================================

This file presents how the MATLAB code is set up for simulating the Anomalous Floquet-Anderson Insulator and shows that the method used for calculating the pumped charge integrated over the appropriate time intervals using analytical integration approaches produces the correct results when compared to using numerical integration approaches. We start with the main file that runs the appropriate files and then plots the data.

Then we have the helper function that creates the matrices that when added to the Hamiltonians, implements the chemical potential disorder.

.. code-block:: matlab

    function magi = TwoDxyNoiseHamiltonians(Li,Lj,chaos)
    % This function calculates a matrix that implements a particular
    % configuration of chemical potential disorder. This matrix is given by
    % magi and is added to each of the Hamiltonians during the time evolution.
    % Li defines the number of sites in the x-direction, Lj defines the number
    % of sites in the y-direction, and chaos defines the strength of the
    % chemical potential disorder.
    %%%
    % Calculate the total number of sites in the system and store the value in
    % LSquared.
    LSquared = 2*Li*Lj;
    % Iterate over all of the sites of the system.
    for i = 1:(LSquared)
        % Generate a random number that is drawn between -W and W where W is 
        % defined by the term chaos.
        candy = -chaos + 2*chaos*rand;
        % Use the random number to apply a random on-site potential
        ioph(i) = candy;
        clear candy
    end
    % Return the resulting matrix as output.
    magi = ioph;
    end

For the Hamiltonians, what we do is divide the cylindrical lattice into unit cells such that each unit cell has two sites in the x (i) direction and one site in the y (j) direction. The leftmost site of each unit cell can be the A site and the rightmost site of the unit cell can be the B site. This division is important for the implementation of the chemical potential, which is done in step five, where site A is evolved to have the opposite phase added as that of site B. It is important to remember that the A sites are always surrounded by B sites in all four directions and the B sites are always surrounded by A sites in all four directions. The wave function is set up to have indices :math:`$|\Psi(\alpha+2\times i+ 2\times \mathrm{L}_i \times j)\rangle$`, where :math:`$\alpha$` can be 1 or 2 depending on whether we are referring to an A or B site, respectively, :math:`$i$` defines the unit cell of interest in the i direction, :math:`$\mathrm{L}_i$` defines how many unit cells there are in the i direction, and :math:`$j$` defines the unit cell of interest in the j direction. 

If this is the case and :math:`$\mathrm{L}_\mathrm{squared}$` defines the number of sites of the system, then the Hamiltonian for the Floquet driving step five is given by:

:math:`$$H_5 = \sum_{k=1}^{\mathrm{L}_\mathrm{squared}} (-1)^{k-1} \times \Delta$$`

where :math:`$\Delta$` defines the strength of the chemical potential. Meanwhile, if we rewrite our wave function expressed above as :math:`$\Psi(i,j,\alpha)$`, then the Hamiltonian for the first four driving steps can be expressed as:

:math:`$$H_{1-4} = -J \sum_{i,j} (|i,j,1\rangle\langle i+a, j+b, 2| + h.c.)$$`

where for :math:`$H_1$`, :math:`$a=b=0$`, for :math:`$H_2$`, :math:`$a = -1$` and :math:`$b = 1$`, for :math:`$H_3$` :math:`$a = -1$` and :math:`$b = 0$`, for :math:`$H_4$`, :math:`$a = 0$` and :math:`$b = -1$`, and :math:`$J$` defines the strength of the hopping term. The velocity matrices presented here for the first and third driving step give the operator :math:`$I_x$` in the corresponding paper. These velocity matrices are given by :math:`$I_x=\frac{\partial H}{\partial \theta_x}$` where :math:`$H$` is the Hamiltonian of interest and :math:`$\theta_x$` is the flux theaded through the cylinder that produces current in the x-direction and can vary from :math:`$0$` to :math:`$2\pi$`. Every term of the hopping matrix that involves crossing the boundary :math:`$x_0$` in the x-direction involves a phase shift of :math:`$e^{i\theta_{x_0}}$` The function that implements all of this is given by:

.. code-block:: matlab

    function [Ham1, Ham2, Ham3, Ham4, Ham5, Vel1, Vel3] = FastTwoDxyHamiltonians(Li,Lj,J,del)
    % This function generates the Hamiltonians that implement the five step
    % Floquet drive as well as the velocity matrices that are used to measure
    % the topological current during the first and third driving steps. The
    % system is defined by Li sites in the x-direction and Lj sites in the
    % y-direction, the hopping strength is given by J, and the strength of the
    % on-site potential implemented during step 5 is given by del.

    % Define the total number of sites that define the system with LSquared

    for i = 2:2:LSquared
        H1(i,(i-1)) = -J;
        H1((i-1),i) = -J;
        V1((i-1),i) = -1i*J;
        V1(i,(i-1)) = 1i*J;
    end
    clear i
    for i = 0:(Li-1)
        for j = 0:(Lj-2)

            H4((1+2*i+2*Li*(j+1)),(2+2*i+2*Li*j)) = -J;
        end
        clear j
        for j = 0:(Lj-1)

        end
    end
    for k = 1:LSquared
        H5(k,k) = ((-1)^(k-1))*del;
    end
    % Give the results as output.
    Ham1 = H1;

Finally, we have the function that gives us the analytical calculation of the charge pumped integrated over a certain time interval:

.. code-block:: matlab

    function y = TwoDPxyMatrix(VelMat,u1,u2,tf,ti,J,step,Li,Lj,magi)
    % This function is used to calcuate the charge pumped integrated over a certain time
    % period so that the computationally expensive method of numerical
    % integration is unneeded. Here, VelMat is the velocity matrix of interest,
    % u1 and u2 are the terms that define the chemical potential disorder, ti
    % is the starting time, tf is the stopping time, J
    % is the hopping strength, step defines whether the driving step of
    % interest is the first or third driving step, and magi is the full matrix
    % that implements the chemical potential disorder. Unfortunately, I have
    % lost the notes that derive the math to form this algorithm, which is why
    % I am showing plots that justify that this is in fact the correct way
    % integrating the expectation value of the velocity matrix over time. If it
    % is deemed necessary for me to find the notes or rederive them, then I
    % will do that.
    LSquared = 2*Li*Lj;
    if step == 1
        SigY = [0 -1i; 1i 0];
        theta = atan(-2*J/(u1-u2));
        Ry = expm(-1i*SigY*theta/2);
        B = ctranspose(Ry)*VelMat*Ry;
        Sec = (u1-u2)*cos(theta)/2-J*sin(theta);
        y = Ry*([B(1,1)*tf (B(1,2)/(2*1i*Sec))*exp(2*1i*Sec*tf); (-B(2,1)/(2*1i*Sec))*exp(-2*1i*Sec*tf) B(2,2)*tf] - [B(1,1)*ti (B(1,2)/(2*1i*Sec))*exp(2*1i*Sec*ti); (-B(2,1)/(2*1i*Sec))*exp(-2*1i*Sec*ti) B(2,2)*ti])*ctranspose(Ry);
    elseif step == 3
        Muy = zeros(LSquared);
        for i = 0:(Li-1)
            for j = 0:(Lj-1)
                u3 = magi((1+2*rem((i+1),Li)+2*Li*j));
                u4 = magi((2+2*i+2*Li*j));
                SigY = [0 -1i; 1i 0];
                theta = atan(-2*J/(u3-u4));

                Sec = (u3-u4)*cos(theta)/2-J*sin(theta);
                Result = Ry*([B(1,1)*tf B(1,2)*exp(2*1i*Sec*tf)/(2*1i*Sec); -B(2,1)*exp(-2*1i*Sec*tf)/(2*1i*Sec) B(2,2)*tf] - [B(1,1)*ti B(1,2)*exp(2*1i*Sec*ti)/(2*1i*Sec); -B(2,1)*exp(-2*1i*Sec*ti)/(2*1i*Sec) B(2,2)*ti])*ctranspose(Ry);

            end
        end
        y = Muy;
    end
    end

If we go back to the file that we presented in the beginning, we are going to see what happens when we set :math:`$iter=100$`, :math:`$iter=1000$`, and then :math:`$iter=10000$`. :math:`$iter$` defines how accurate we want our numerical integration to be, with a higher value indicating a more accurate calculation. We are also going to set our chemical potential and temporal disorder to have a strength defined by non-zero values. For :math:`$iter=100$`, we have:

.. image:: Iteris100withTemporalDisorder.png

For :math:`$iter=1000$`, we have:

.. image:: Iteris1000withTemporalDisorder.png

For :math:`$iter=10000$`, we have:

.. image:: Iteris10000withTemporalDisorder.png

This shows us that as we increase the accuracy of our numerical integration technique by an order of magnitude, the size of the error drops by around an order of magnitude as well. Thus we have successfully produced code that calculates the charge pumped integrated over time through analytical means, which greatly increases speed and accuracy of our calculation.
