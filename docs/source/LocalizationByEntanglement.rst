Presentation of the Code that Demonstrates Localization when the Time Evolution is Frequently Interrupted by Quantum Entanglement
=================================================================================================================================

As stated by the title, this document presents the code that shows how systems become localized when their time evolution is frequently interrupted by quantum entanglement. The explanation for how this process works is given both by the comments within the code as well as in the corresponding article itself. First, we start with the main file that runs the file that obtains the data and then plots the information from that data.

Here is the helper function that generates the matrices that implement the temporal disorder when added to the Hamiltonians.

.. code-block:: matlab

   function magi = TwoDxyNoiseHamiltonians(Li,Lj,chaos)
   % This function calculates a matrix that implements a particular
   % configuration of chemical potential disorder. This matrix is given by
   % magi and is added to each of the Hamiltonians during the time evolution.
   % Li defines the number of sites in the x-direction, Lj defines the number
   % of sites in the y-direction, and chaos defines the strength of the
   % chemical potential disorder.
   %%%
   % Calculate the total number of sites in the system and store the value in
   % LSquared.
   LSquared = 2*Li*Lj;
   % Iterate over all of the sites of the system.
   for i = 1:(LSquared)
       % Generate a random number that is drawn between -W and W.
       candy = -chaos + 2*chaos*rand;
       % Use the random number to apply a random on-site potential
       ioph(i) = candy;
       clear candy
   end
   % Return the resulting matrix as output.
   magi = ioph;
   end

Then there is the helper function that generates the Hamiltonians for the five driving steps as well as the velocity matrices for the first and third driving steps.

.. code-block:: matlab

   function [Ham1, Ham2, Ham3, Ham4, Ham5, Vel1, Vel3] = FastTwoDxyHamiltonians(Li,Lj,J,del)
   % This function generates the Hamiltonians that implement the five step
   % Floquet drive as well as the velocity matrices that are used to measure
   % the topological current during the first and third driving steps. The
   % system is defined by Li sites in the x-direction and Lj sites in the
   % y-direction, the hopping strength is given by J, and the strength of the
   % on-site potential implemented during step 5 is given by del.
   %%%
   % Define the total number of sites that defines the system with LSquared
   LSquared = 2*Li*Lj;
   % Initialize all of the Hamiltonians and the velocity matrices as matrices
   % of zeros
   Muy = zeros(LSquared);
   H1 = Muy;
   H2 = Muy;
   H3 = Muy;
   H4 = Muy;
   H5 = Muy;
   V1 = Muy;
   V3 = Muy;
   % Populate all of the Hamiltonians and the velocity matrices in the
   % appropriate locations such that they perform that actions they were
   % intended to.
   for i = 2:2:LSquared
       H1(i,(i-1)) = -J;
       H1((i-1),i) = -J;
       V1((i-1),i) = -1i*J;
       V1(i,(i-1)) = 1i*J;
   end
   clear i
   for i = 0:(Li-1)
       for j = 0:(Lj-2)
           H2((2+2*i+2*Li*(j+1)),(1+2*rem((i+1),Li)+2*Li*j)) = -J;

           H4((2+2*i+2*Li*j),(1+2*i+2*Li*(j+1))) = -J;
           H4((1+2*i+2*Li*(j+1)),(2+2*i+2*Li*j)) = -J;
       end
       clear j
       for j = 0:(Lj-1)

           V3((2+2*i+2*Li*j),(1+2*rem((i+1),Li)+2*Li*j)) = 1i*J;
       end
   end
   for k = 1:LSquared
       H5(k,k) = ((-1)^(k-1))*del;
   end
   % Give the results as output.
   Ham1 = H1;
   Ham2 = H2;
   Ham3 = H3;
   Ham4 = H4;
   Ham5 = H5;
   Vel1 = V1;
   Vel3 = V3;
   end

Finally, we have the helper function that calculates the reduced density matrices given an input matrix as well as a list of target qubits to construct the reduced density matrix from.

.. code-block:: matlab

   function [rdensity] = ReducedDensity(densityi,size,targets)
   % This function takes the density matrix densityi composed of size qubits
   % and calculates the reduced density matrix for the qubits given by targets
   % and returns this reduced density matrix as rdensity

   % Initialize the matrix that will store the reduced density matrix
   redden = zeros(2^nq);
   % Iterate over all possible configurations of the qubits that will not
   % compose the reduced density matrix
   for i = 0:(2^nq2-1)
       % Express the number for the current iteration as a bitstring of length
       % nq2
       const = dec2bin(i);
       const2 = nq2 - length(const);
       for j = 1:const2
           const = ['0' const];
       end
       % count is used to determine how far across the bitstring we have gone
       % when using the information in the bitstring to generate the matrix
       % opmat that will be used to create the reduced density matrix.
       count = 0;
       % If 1 is an entry of targets, then make the first matrix that composes
       % the set of Kronecker products that generates opmat be the 2 by 2
       % identity matrix
       if sum(1==targets)
           opmat = eye(2);
       % Otherwise make the first matrix that composes this set of Kronecker
       % products be the appropriate single qubit spin vector
       else
           count = count+1;
           if (const(count)=='1')
               opmat = [0; 1];
           else
               opmat = [1; 0];
           end
       end
       % Iterate through all of the rest of the qubits (both the target qubits
       % for the reduced density matrix as well as all of the other qubits)
       % and determine whether the next matrix in the set of Kronecker

       % vector. If the qubit of interest is a target qubit for the reduced
       % density matrix then use the identity matrix otherwise use the
       % appropriate state vector.
       for j = 2:size
           if sum(j==targets)
               opmat = kron(opmat,eye(2));
           else
               count = count + 1;
               if (const(count)=='1')
                   opmat = kron(opmat,[0; 1]);
               else
                   opmat = kron(opmat,[1; 0]);
               end
           end
       end
       % Use opmat to perform operations on densityi in order to obtain the
       % appropriate information about the reduced density matrix and add this
       % information to redden.
       redden = redden + ctranspose(opmat)*densityi*opmat;
   end
   % Normalize redden
   redden = redden/trace(abs(redden));
   % Return the reduced density matrix as rdensity
   rdensity = redden;
   end
