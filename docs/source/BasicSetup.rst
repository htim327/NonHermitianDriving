Presenting the code for the basic setup of non-Hermitian driving
================================================================

The first part of this documentation gives the main MATLAB file along with explanatory comments that let's you see how the process of non-Hermitian driving is set up. This is followed by a series of helper functions that are needed for the code to work properly.

For the helper functions, we will start with the function that obtains vectors that are orthogonal to the target state using the Gram-Schmidt process.

.. code-block:: matlab

    function [orthvec] = FindOrths(initorth,num)
    % This algorithm produces a set of orthogonal vectors using the
    % Gram–Schmidt process. initorth is set of pre-generated
    % vectors, which can also be a completely empty vector if you don't have any use for any pre-generated vectors. num is the number of orthogonal vectors you wish to produce.
    %%%
    % initnum describes how many vectors make up initorth
    initnum = size(initorth,2);
    % normalize the first vector in initorth
    if (initnum>0)
       vecnow = initorth(:,1);
       const = ctranspose(vecnow)*vecnow;
       vecnow = vecnow/sqrt(const);
       initorth(:,1) = vecnow;
    end
    % calculate how many more vectors you want to add
    initadd = num - initnum;
    % Generate additional vectors that will be used to construct vectors that
    % are orthogonal to initorth and store them in orthtot
    orthadd = -ones(num,initadd) + 2*rand(num,initadd) - 1i*ones(num,initadd) + 2i*rand(num,initadd);
    orthtot = [initorth orthadd];
    % Normalize the first vector of orthtot
    vecnow = orthtot(:,1);
    const = ctranspose(vecnow)*vecnow;
    vecnow = vecnow/sqrt(const);
    orthtot(:,1) = vecnow;
    % Implement the Gram–Schmidt process
    for i = 2:num
       vecnow1 = orthtot(:,i);
       for j = 1:(i-1)
          uvec = orthtot(:,j);
          vecnow1 = vecnow1 - ctranspose(uvec)*vecnow1/(ctranspose(uvec)*uvec)*uvec;
       end
       const = ctranspose(vecnow1)*vecnow1;
       vecnow1 = vecnow1/sqrt(const);
       orthtot(:,i) = vecnow1;
    end
    orthvec = orthtot;
    end

Then we have the function that generates the matrices that rotate the qubits from the target state to the orthogonal state and vice versa as well as the matrices that add a phase of negative one if the qubit is in the orthogonal state and leaves it alone if it is in the target state.

.. code-block:: matlab

    function [interference,rotation] = StateProcessing(tarstates)
    % This function constructs the rotations that are applied to the qubits in
    % the second register if the corresponding qubit in the first register is
    % in the spin up state as well as the matrices that applies a phase of
    % negative one to a qubit in the second register if it is in a state
    % orthogonal to the target state.
    dim = size(tarstates,3);
    interferencea = zeros(2,2,dim);
    rotationa = zeros(2,2,dim);
    for i = 1:dim
       vec1 = tarstates(:,1,i);
       vec2 = tarstates(:,2,i);
       interferencea(:,:,i) = interferencea(:,:,i) + vec1*ctranspose(vec1) - vec2*ctranspose(vec2);
       rotationa(:,:,i) = rotationa(:,:,i) + vec1*ctranspose(vec2) + vec2*ctranspose(vec1);
    end
    interference = interferencea;
    rotation = rotationa;
    end

The code below shows how noise using the Pauli channel is implemented.

.. code-block:: matlab

    function [densityf] = PauliKraus(densityi,indvec,size,prob,iter)
    % This function implements noise using the Pauli channel. indvec describes
    % the particular qubits that this noise is applied to, size describes the
    % number of qubits defines the size of the system, prob describes the
    % probabilities associated with implementing rotations defined by each of
    % the Pauli matrices, and iter describes how many times the appropriate
    % Kraus operator is implemented.
    %%%
    % Store the Pauli matrices as well as the identity matrix in sigies
    sigies = zeros(2,2,4);
    sigies(:,:,1) = [0 1; 1 0];
    sigies(:,:,2) = [0 -1i; 1i 0];
    sigies(:,:,3) = [1 0; 0 -1];
    sigies(:,:,4) = [1 0; 0 1];
    densityb = zeros(2^size);
    % Iterate over all indices where the noise is applied
    for i = 1:length(indvec)
       kraussback = zeros(2^size,2^size,4);
       % Iterate over all of the matrices within sigies
       for j = 1:4
          kraussshort = zeros(2,2,size);
          % Iterate over all of the qubits
          for k = 1:size
                % If the qubit is supposed to have noise applied to it, apply
                % noise to it, otherwise do nothing.
                if (k==indvec(i))
                   kraussshort(:,:,k) = sqrt(prob(j))*sigies(:,:,j);
                else
                   kraussshort(:,:,k) = [1 0; 0 1];
                end
          end
          kraussnow = kron(kraussshort(:,:,1),kraussshort(:,:,2));
          for k = 3:size
                kraussnow = kron(kraussnow,kraussshort(:,:,k));
          end
          kraussback(:,:,j) = kraussnow;
       end
       % Apply the Kraus operators to the density matrix of interest
       for j = 1:iter
          for k = 1:4
                densityb = densityb + kraussback(:,:,k)*densityi*ctranspose(kraussback(:,:,k));
          end
          densityb = densityb/trace(abs(densityb));
          densityi = densityb;
       end
    end
    densityf = densityb;
    end

The following code produces the correction unitary.

.. code-block:: matlab

    function [densityf] = SpinCorrection(densityi,nqubits,rotation)
    % This function calculates the correction unitary that brings the qubits in
    % the second register to the target state. densityi is the density matrix
    % that we wish to apply the correction unitary to, nqubits is the number of
    % qubits that compose the system described by this density matrix, and
    % rotation describe the set of rotations that are applied to the qubits in
    % the second register.
    cormat = zeros(2^(2*nqubits),2^(2*nqubits));
    % Iterate over all possible configurations that the qubits in the first
    % register can be in
    for i = 0:(2^nqubits-1)
       const = dec2bin(i);
       const2 = nqubits - length(const);
       for j = 1:const2
          const = ['0' const];
       end
       cormat2 = zeros(2,2,2^(2*nqubits));
       % If a qubit in the first register is spin up, apply the appropriate
       % rotation to the corresponding qubit in the second register, otherwise
       % apply an identity matrix
       for j = 1:nqubits
          if (const(j)=='1')
                cormat2(:,:,j) = [0 0; 0 1];
                cormat2(:,:,j+nqubits) = rotation(:,:,j);
          else
                cormat2(:,:,j) = [1 0; 0 0];
                cormat2(:,:,j+nqubits) = eye(2);
          end
       end
       statemat = kron(cormat2(:,:,1),cormat2(:,:,2));
       for j = 3:(2*nqubits)
          statemat = kron(statemat,cormat2(:,:,j));
       end
       cormat = cormat + statemat;
    end
    % Apply the correction unitary to the density matrix given as input and
    % return the result as densityf
    densitynow = cormat*densityi*ctranspose(cormat);
    densitynow = densitynow/trace(abs(densitynow));
    densityf = densitynow;
    end

Finally, we have the code that calculates the reduced density matrix.

.. code-block:: matlab

    function [rdensity] = ReducedDensity(densityi,size,targets)
    % This function calculates the reduced the reduced density matrix of the
    % density matrix defined by the number of qubits given by size and where
    % the particular reduced density matrix describes the qubits given by
    % targets.
    nq = length(targets);
    nq2 = size - nq;
    redden = zeros(2^nq);
    for i = 0:(2^nq2-1)
       const = dec2bin(i);
       const2 = nq2 - length(const);
       for j = 1:const2
          const = ['0' const];
       end
       count = 0;
       if sum(1==targets)
          opmat = eye(2);
       else
          count = count+1;
          if (const(count)=='1')
                opmat = [0; 1];
          else
                opmat = [1; 0];
          end
       end
       for j = 2:size
          if sum(j==targets)
                opmat = kron(opmat,eye(2));
          else
                count = count + 1;
                if (const(count)=='1')
                   opmat = kron(opmat,[0; 1]);
                else
                   opmat = kron(opmat,[1; 0]);
                end
          end
       end
       redden = redden + ctranspose(opmat)*densityi*opmat;
    end
    redden = redden/trace(abs(redden));
    rdensity = redden;
    end

Results
=======

Now we are going to present the output of this code, which serves as a proof that this code is doing what it is supposed to. These results are not presented in the corresponding paper because they do not make a significant contribution to the overall story. First we are going to present the data for the target states produced by a random number generator and then we are going to present the data for the case where the target states for all of the qubits are in the spin down state.

Random target states
--------------------

The image below displays the results for the system where the target state is reached in the second register as a result of operations involving qubits in the first register. The image shows the the resulting entropy of the qubits in the second register is zero due to the fact that the qubits are guaranteed to be in their target states and all of the entropy has moved to the qubits in the first register. Just for general reference, the probabilities for each of the qubits to point in the spin up and down directions along the x, y, and z axes are printed after the entropy is displayed.

.. image:: EntropyEliminatedRandomTargetStates.png

Next, we have the system that is the exact same as that of the previous image except for the implementation of the correction unitary. The interesting aspect for this data is that the entropy of both of the registers is higher than the entropy of the first register in the image above and both of the entropies are exactly the same. It makes sense that both the entropies would be exactly the same because the information stored in the first register is required to eliminate the entropy in the second register, which is why the mystical sounding term 'entropic interference' is used.

.. image:: NonEntropicInterferenceRandomTargetStates.png

Finally, we display the data for the system that is essentially the qubits in the second register completely unacted upon by the qubits in the first register. It is shown that the total entropy of this system is exactly the same as the entropy of the first register for the system where the entropy is eliminated from the second register. In addition, the final line of data displays whether or not the state achieved in the second register using the entropic interference method is exactly the same as the target state we wish to evolve our system to.

.. image:: QubitsUnactedUponRandomTargetStates.png

All target states in the spin down state
----------------------------------------

For this next set of data, we are going to look at what happens when we set all of the target states into the spin down state by setting the variable :math:`state` to 'b'. First we are going to look at the data for the case where our algorithm brings the qubits in the second register into the spin down state.

.. image:: EntropyEliminatedSpinDownTargetStates.png

Next, we are going to look at the case where we implement all of the operations on the qubits in both registers with the exception of the implementation of the correction unitary. The interesting thing about this set of data is that the qubits in the first register have their relative probabilities maintained in the z-direction after having all of the controlled unitaries act on them, but the probabilities in the x and y directions are altered. This is an example of qubits that serve as control qubits being rotated about the z-axis such that there is equal probability of observing the qubits in the spin up and down x and y directions. This is similar to how the qubits would behave after being measured in the z direction.

.. image:: NonEntropicInterferenceSpinDownTargetStates.png

Finally, we have the system that describes the qubits in the second register when they are completely unacted upon by the qubits in the first register. This data shows that we have essentially created a set of swap gates between the qubits in the second register along with their corresponding qubits in the first register.
